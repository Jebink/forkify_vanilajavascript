## About

This is a cookbook application that contains recipes for multiple different foods within categories. The user will then select the food he/she likes and the recipe view will be shown with much more details. The user will then be able to add the necessary ingredients to shopping cart.

1. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `npm i`.
2. Prepare for production using `npm run build`.
3. Run with your live server program, in VS Code an extension called Live Server will work
4. Enjoy the app :+1: :)
